# Project-3-Baby-Mood-Prediction-via-Deep-Neural-Networks
Scientific Question: Can prediction algorithms be utilized to predict baby moods, such as, happiness, sadness, fright, disgust, hunger, thirst, and sleepiness from neural frequencies?
For the project to run one must intall Keras into their environment. 
MNIST is a part of Keras so no other input files should be necessary.
Tensorflow may also need to be installed into the environment.
